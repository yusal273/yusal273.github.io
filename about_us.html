      <p>We are an innovative, commercial contemporary-luxury-residential real estate developer in Nigeria.  Since the delivery of our first set of unique, and beautifully crafted homes with luxurious interior designs in 2006, we have seen our stunning homes constitute a valuable addition to Nigerian residential architecture. Our designs inspired a revolution with some of the subsequent best home designs in the country carrying many of the signatures we introduced. Hence our reputation as the pioneers of commercial contemporary architecture in Nigeria.  Before our arrival on the scene, what we now term ‘affordable luxury’ was only available to the super rich. We are pleased to declare that we have raised the bar for what can be considered luxury, bringing beautiful homes in secure and serene estates with amazing aesthetics and super functionality closer to the not-so-super rich.  Haven Homes is the Real Estate subsidiary of Haven Global Resources Ltd, registered as a limited liability company in Nigeria.  Our luxury homes present the occupiers with a very comfortable home life experience. We specialize in creating homes that model after the rich, luxurious, western aristocratic homes previously only seen in movies, so much so that we have been trying so hard over the years to convince people at home and abroad that our pictures are real homes that we have built in Nigeria.  As a top developer in Nigeria, we have advanced beyond selling futuristic 3D Images of barren lands. For the past fourteen years, we have built a verifiable track record of reliably completing and delivering homes and investment properties on-schedule that turn out better than our 3D images initially showed.  We have also, during this period, satisfied our customers with ultra luxurious homes and condos and top investment opportunities that offer unique and individual layouts, abundant natural light, mezzanine levels, galleries, bridges, atriums, roof terraces and many more creature comforts in the home.  Our growing list of customers include Top Celebrities who appreciate style and class with beauty and being widely travelled, they have desired to return to a home befitting of their international stardom. These celebs are at home with Haven Homes!  With only 30% Down Payment of agreed price of a home, you too can join a growing list of customers who are now living their dreams in our homes or simply just adding our homes into their portfolio of Investment Properties. Please pay a visit to our gallery page to see what we have built so far and also see what we’re currently selling on our now selling page.  WorldRent… Live your dreams</p>
